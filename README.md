# Project Overview and Objective

<mark>(intro & business case)<mark>

<mark>Customer Personality Analysis is a crucial step in understanding consumer behavior and tailoring business strategies accordingly. This project aims to segment customers using clustering techniques and develop a predictive model to assess the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. By leveraging machine learning, we seek to provide actionable insights that enhance marketing efficiency and customer satisfaction.<mark>

## Business Case Objective

<mark>[x]<mark>

### Stakeholders & Their Interests
<mark>- **Marketing Teams**: Optimize campaigns by targeting the right customer segments.<mark>
<mark>- **Business Executives**: Improve decision-making regarding product offerings and promotions.<mark>
<mark>- **Data Science Teams**: Implement machine learning models to refine customer segmentation and predictive analytics.<mark>

### Business Value
<mark>- **Enhanced Marketing Strategies**: More targeted and cost-effective promotional campaigns.<mark>
<mark>- **Customer-Centric Approach**: Personalization of marketing efforts to improve customer experience.<mark>
<mark>- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Leveraging machine learning to extract insights and improve business strategies.<mark>

### Objectives
<mark>Our project aims to:<mark>
<mark>1. **Segment customers** based on purchasing behavior and demographics using clustering techniques. For example, can we classify customers as high-value or budget shoppers based on their purchasing behavior and promotional usage?<mark>
<mark>2. **Develop a predictive model** to analyze the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. For example, can we predict their likelihood of responding to future marketing campaigns using past data?<mark>
<mark>3. **Provide insights** on optimizing marketing efforts to increase customer engagement and revenue.<mark>

# Understanding The Data

<mark>The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis), provides a comprehensive view of customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and promotional engagement. The data is valuable for businesses looking to optimize marketing efforts and better understand customer segments.<mark>

<mark>[summary of data (e.g., # of rows, # of columns, shape, etc.]<mark>

## Required Libraries

<mark>[x]<mark>

## Key Attributes:
<mark>- **Demographics**: Birth year, education, marital status, income, household composition<mark>
<mark>- **Purchase Behavior**: Spending across different product categories, such as wine, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, and gold<mark>
<mark>- **Promotion Response**: Whether customers accepted promotional offers across multiple campaigns<mark>
<mark>- **Engagement**: Frequency of purchases made via the web, catalogs, and physical stores, along with website visit frequency<mark>
<mark>- **Recency & Complaints**: Last purchase recency and whether a customer has raised complaints in the past two years<mark>

## Key Features

<mark>[x]<mark>

## Data Set Limitations: 
<mark>The dataset with 2240 rows and 29 attributes is mostly clean. The below is a list of limitations on dataset.<mark>
<mark>- **Missing income data**: Out of 2240 rows, 24 rows don’t have income.<mark>
<mark>- **Limited transaction history**: The dataset covers spending from the last 2 years, but it lacks specific timestamps for individual transactions.<mark>
<mark>- **Limited information**: No information on product preferences beyond spending categories (e.g., no breakdown by products’ brands). No customer feedback data (aside from complaints), which could help refine engagement strategies.<mark>

## Risks and Uncertainties
<mark>- **Data Set Size and Limitations**: The dataset consists of only 2,240 records, which may limit model performance and generalizability.<mark>
<mark>- **Model Generalization**: Clustering and predictive models might not generalize well across different customer groups.<mark>
<mark>- **External Factors**: Economic changes, seasonal trends, or competitive actions could influence customer behavior in ways not captured by historical data.<mark>

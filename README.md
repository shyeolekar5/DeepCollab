# Project Overview and Objective

`Understanding a customer's shopping personality is a crucial step in developing a personalized marketing strategy for your customer. Our project aims to help businesses better understand their customers by providing an in-depth analysis of "customer personalities". By gaining a deeper understanding of these personalities, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to target the right customers with the right content at the right time.`

`Our approach involves using K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct "shopping profiles", and a [type of predictive model we used] predictive model to assess how likely each customer is to respond to a future marketing campaign. This allows marketing teams to optimize their resources by better understanding how to engage with their customers and by focusing on the segments most likely to repond, thereby improving the effectiveness of their campaigns and maximizing ROI.`

`Through this analysis, businesses will gain valuable insights into their customer base, enabling them to refine their marketing strategies and deliver more personalized, targeted experiences. This project ultimately aims to help businesses:`

`1. Better understand how to engage with each profile, and aim to **increase customer engagement** through tailored interactions that resonate with each customer's individual preferences and behaviors.`

`2. **Drive sales** by implementing hyper-personalized marketing strategies that align with the specific needs and desires of each profile.`

`3. **Optimize marketing resources and efforts** by effectively targeting each profile, and ensuring that campaigns are directed at the most responsive and relevant customers.`

### Stakeholders & Their Interests
`- **Marketing Teams**: Optimize campaigns by targeting the right customers with the right content at the right time.`

`- **Business Executives**: Improve decision-making regarding product offerings and promotions.`

`- **Data Science Teams**: Implement machine learning models to refine customer segmentation and predictive analytics.`


### Business Value
`- **Enhanced Marketing Strategies**: More targeted and cost-effective promotional campaigns.`

`- **Customer-Centric Approach**: Personalization of marketing efforts to improve customer experience.`

`- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Leveraging machine learning to extract insights and improve business strategies.`

# Understanding The Data

<mark>The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis), provides a comprehensive view of customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and promotional engagement. The data is valuable for businesses looking to optimize marketing efforts and better understand customer segments.<mark>

<mark>[summary of data (e.g., # of rows, # of columns, shape, etc.]<mark>

## Required Libraries

<mark>[x]<mark>

## Key Attributes:
<mark>- **Demographics**: Birth year, education, marital status, income, household composition<mark>
<mark>- **Purchase Behavior**: Spending across different product categories, such as wine, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, and gold<mark>
<mark>- **Promotion Response**: Whether customers accepted promotional offers across multiple campaigns<mark>
<mark>- **Engagement**: Frequency of purchases made via the web, catalogs, and physical stores, along with website visit frequency<mark>
<mark>- **Recency & Complaints**: Last purchase recency and whether a customer has raised complaints in the past two years<mark>

## Key Features

<mark>[x]<mark>

## Data Set Limitations: 
<mark>The dataset with 2240 rows and 29 attributes is mostly clean. The below is a list of limitations on dataset.<mark>
<mark>- **Missing income data**: Out of 2240 rows, 24 rows don’t have income.<mark>
<mark>- **Limited transaction history**: The dataset covers spending from the last 2 years, but it lacks specific timestamps for individual transactions.<mark>
<mark>- **Limited information**: No information on product preferences beyond spending categories (e.g., no breakdown by products’ brands). No customer feedback data (aside from complaints), which could help refine engagement strategies.<mark>

## Risks and Uncertainties
<mark>- **Data Set Size and Limitations**: The dataset consists of only 2,240 records, which may limit model performance and generalizability.<mark>
<mark>- **Model Generalization**: Clustering and predictive models might not generalize well across different customer groups.<mark>
<mark>- **External Factors**: Economic changes, seasonal trends, or competitive actions could influence customer behavior in ways not captured by historical data.<mark>
